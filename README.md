Welcome to the Puppy Bowl! 

Main branch is just a single-page application to display an entire list of puppies from an API and render additional details of puppies that were clicked on by the user!

The pokemonAPI branch serves to build on the Main branch by adding additional CSS to make the page look prettier and some additional JavaScript to add a small, random Pokemon sprite to the bottom right of the page- it refreshes every time theres a hashchange!
